# Feed-the-Tigers
A simple game where the objective is to feed tigers meat. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the tracker, and hold down and release the space bar to fire the meat. The longer the space bar is held down, the further and faster the meat will travel.

# Motivation
Created as an assignment for my grade 11 computer science final project where we were tasked with designing a "classic game" but in video game version. This game was modeled after ring tossing but features moving tigers to increase the difficulty and meat which is fed to the tigers in place of the rings.
